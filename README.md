## Roadmap
**Objective**: The main objective of the project is to develop a system that can automatically generate concise summaries of chat conversations.

**Data Collection**: The project typically starts with collecting a dataset of chat conversations. 

**SAMSum Corpus**: A Human-annotated Dialogue Dataset for Abstractive Summarization. SAMSum Corpus contains over 16k chat dialogues with manually annotated

**Preprocessing**: The collected data needs to be preprocessed to make it in a proper format for the training and testing

**Model**:The Pegasus model is used in this project which was proposed in PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization by Jingqing Zhang, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh and Peter J. Liu on Dec 18, 2019.

**Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is used to measure the quality of the generated summaries compared to human-generated references.

**Model Deployment**: The best-performing model was then deployed using Flask, a lightweight web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. This allowed the model to be accessed via a simple web interface, enabling real-time predictions.

Overall, this project aims to improve the efficiency of communication in chat interfaces by providing users with concise and informative summaries of their conversations.


## Lessons Learned

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply NLP concepts to a real-world problem. It was particularly interesting to see how simple text is transformed into numbers and how the operation on these numbers affect the text.

Iâ€™m excited about the potential applications of this project and look forward to exploring more ways to leverage NLP in the future. ðŸ’¡
